# Webpack 2 Boilerplate

This is a complete Gulp workflow setup bundled with Rollup and Webpack 2 using TypeScript and Stylus with compilation and linting functionality. To show how to use webpack together with a server, there's a `server.js` file with a basic ExpressJS setup.

Simply work with the files in the `src` folder, WebPack will automatically compile and reload the files in the browser. The ExpressJS server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

The build system processes all files using Gulp + Rollup into the `build` folder, then bundles everything for production using Webpack 2, inside the `dist` folder.


### Development Server
To run the ExpressJS development server use:
~~~
npm start
~~~

Or, to use the included WebPack dev server:
~~~
npm run dev
~~~


### Production Server
To run the production server, first create the assets bundle, then use:
~~~
npm run build

NODE_ENV=production npm start
~~~

## Configuration
To update the current configuration, make sure you modify the files in the `config` folder.
