# The perfect gulp setup
This project aims to create a modular and configurable gulp setup. Get project automation up and running with minimum involvement.

~~~
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install gulp gulp-load-plugins gulp-setup --save-dev
~~~

## Sample `gulpfile.js`
Setting up gulp using gulp-setup is simpler than ever.
~~~
const gulp = require('gulp');
const plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
const setup = require('gulp-setup')(plugins, gulp);
~~~

### Default Tasks
By default, gulp-setup comes bundled with a variety of pre-made tasks.
~~~
gulp
gulp build
gulp clean
gulp html
gulp css
gulp sass
gulp stylus
gulp javascript
~~~


## Configuration
Here's a sample configuration for gulp-setup which provides `clean` and `html` tasks.
```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
const setup = require('gulp-setup')(plugins, gulp, {
  src: 'path/to/src',
  build: 'path/to/build',
  dist: 'path/to/dist',
  cache: true,
  debug: true,
  tasks: {
    clean: {
      process: 'gulp-setup/tasks/clean',
    },
    html: {
      process: 'gulp-setup/tasks/html',
      base: 'gulp-setup/base/compile',
      pattern: '**/*.html'
    }
  }
});
```

## Writing a task
The tasks present in gulp-setup are made out of two components: `process` and `base`. All other parameters, such as `pattern`, are made available in these components.

- The __base__ task
The `base` task serves as a template for other tasks. It makes four pipeline hooks available: `init`, `build`, `dist` and `end` for integrating a process into it. If the `base` task is missing, then the `process` is considered as a standalone task and won't use a template.

~~~
module.exports = ($, gulp, config, task) => () =>
  gulp.src($.path.join(config.src, task.pattern))
    .pipe(task.process.init())
    .pipe($.debug())
    .pipe(task.process.build())
    .pipe(gulp.dest(config.build))
    .pipe(task.process.dist())
    .pipe(gulp.dest(config.dist))
    .pipe(task.process.end());
~~~

- The __process__ task
The process task is the main processing that the task is concerned with. It can either be a standalone gulp task, or if combined with a `base` task, it will provide the base hooks for the `base` template.

__Template__
~~~
module.exports = ($, gulp, config, task) => ({
  build: $.lazypipe()
    .pipe($.autoprefixer),
  dist: $.lazypipe()
    .pipe($.cssmin)
});
~~~

__Standalone__
~~~
module.exports = ($, gulp, config, task) => {
  return () => gulp.src([config.build, config.dist])
    .pipe($.clean());
}
~~~
